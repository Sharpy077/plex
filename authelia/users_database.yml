It was replaced for a few reasons. Specifically it was confusing to users due to arguments which only had an effect on one algorithm and not the other, and the new command makes the available options a lot clearer. In addition the old command was not compatible with all of the available algorithms the new one is compatible for and retrofitting it would be incredibly difficult. "  # Change this
