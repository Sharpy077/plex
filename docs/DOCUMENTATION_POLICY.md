# Documentation Policy and Standards

## Purpose
This document establishes the standards and procedures for creating, maintaining, and updating documentation across the project. Following these guidelines ensures consistency, clarity, and usefulness of all documentation.

## Documentation Structure

### 1. File Organization
- All documentation must be stored in the `/docs` directory
- Use clear, descriptive filenames in kebab-case (e.g., `network-topology.md`)
- Group related documents using subdirectories when necessary
- Maintain the documentation index in `README.md`

### 2. File Format Standards
- Use Markdown (.md) for all documentation files
- Include a table of contents for documents longer than 100 lines
- Use proper Markdown heading hierarchy (H1 -> H2 -> H3)
- Include metadata header when applicable:
  ```markdown
  ---
  title: Document Title
  last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
  maintainer: [Name/Team]
  status: [Draft/Review/Approved]
  ---
  ```
